                    <h3>Where I grew up...</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was born in Lansing, Michigan and raised in a small town called Elsie. Yes, like Elsie the cow. The town was named after
                        the first baby girl born there and later a dairy cow was also named Elsie. There are 3000 cows and about 1000 residents. Pretty
                        interesting, yeah? Anyway, most of my young life my Dad raised me and we moved back and fourth between Lansing and Elsie. When
                        I was in third grade we moved in with my grandpa to take care of him. We lived with my grandfather until I was 16 when he passed
                        away. During this time the housing bubble had crashed and my Dads factory job moved over seas. We didn't have much while I was
                        growing up, but we always had food on the table and clothes to wear. I had also started working when I was 14 to help out. 
                        So after my grandpa passed we lost the house because the morgage was too much for my Dad and Step-mom to pay. We moved to Nebraska 
                        to be close to my father's brother. When I turned 17 my Dad allowed me to move back to Michigan. I attended my senior year 
                        with my life long friends, worked full time, and managed to graduate with honors.

                    <h3>My Twenties...</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I turned 19 I put my education plans on hold and got married. (worst idea ever) When I turned 23 I got divorced. (best idea ever)
                        For a few years I went from job to job between retail and food service and atteneded a community college for business management. 
                        Then with only one semester left, I moved to Arizona and attended The Art Institute as an animation student trying to make my dream 
                        come true. Eventually though, I had to leave the school because it was just too much money. I worked 2 jobs for a while to get by and in
                        2016 I moved back to Michigan to be with family. I moved in with my Mom and my Aunt in the Detroit area.

                    <h3>Me Currently...</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the Spring of 2017 I made friends with a gentleman I served lunch to in the cafe I worked in and guess what?! He worked as a front-end developer
                        for a local morgage company. He told me about what he does as a develper and I mentioned how I had done some HTML and CSS in high school and in 
                        college, and my experience I had with it on my own. Then one day we were having lunch at one of Detroit's many fine establishments and he asked
                        me why I don't get into web development since I seemed to enjoy it. Good question friend! And so, that fall I started college in Web Programming.
                        Not long after classes started, I found out that my Dad was very sick. His liver had significant cirrhosis and was going to need a transplant. He lives
                        about 2 hours north of me with family and they are all too busy, too sick, or too old to help him out. As a result, I now make regular trips up
                        north to take him to appointments and help him keep the information straight. His memory has declined as a result of the liver disease. I also helped him
                        take the steps to get on the liver transplant list, and sign up for disability. Once that is decided I will live with him, complete school, and do everything
                        in my power to get a great developer job. I know they are out there! Then I can make money doing what I love, and help my Dad in any way I possibly can.
